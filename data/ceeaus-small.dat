  In my opinion, itÅfs important for students to have a part-time job. But I argue that the job must be a proper part-time job. There are many advantages for a student to have a proper part-time job. For instance, a proper part-time job can help students to realize that no success comes from noting. It also enables students to be independent and build up their self-confidence. In addition, a proper part-time can make the students out of the ivory tower and give them lots of opportunities to know more of themselves and the society. In the same time, students can realize their personal value in society by having a proper part-time job.     Of course, as we all known, everything has two sides. If we do not know the balance between part-time and learning, something bad will occur to us. In other words, an improper part-time job will bring many disadvantages to us. For example, an improper part-time job must occupy studentsÅf time and make them just pay their attention on money but not what they should to learn.   In a word, a part-time job is important for the students, but the students must keep a good balance between part-time and their learning.   
With the development of the living conditions and qualities, quite more and more students have the opportunity to go to college .Parents and the public are concerned with college studentsÅf development .A great many people start to pay more attention on part-time job. Some people hold the view that part-time jobs will affect studentsÅf study in college. In my opinion, a part-time job can help a lot. First of all, knowledge should be put into proactive. Through a part-time job, we can better understand what we have learned in college. Also, we can gain much more than what we have learned from books. Moreover a part-time job is a bridge which connects the college period and the career period after graduation. Some students will feel to have no direction when they graduate of they have never had part-time jobs in college. Since fierce competition is waiting for them, they have little time to adjust to the new environment. IT is not easy for then to learn how companies and working. Yet,Å@if they once had part-time jobs. They will better get involved in the jobs they do. Last but not least, a part-time job can help one build up social relationship and will make one feel more confident.  The modern society needs talents that develop in all directions.  What we learn from textbooks is far less than enough. A part-time job will make up our disadvantages effectively.    
Recently, I found some people are discussing warmly on weather it is important for college student to have a part-time job. Someone think it is a waste of time for student who should spend much of in studying while some believe that it is a good chance for student to get the knowledge on how to earn money and how to live in the society which they have to learn when they leave school.   To my point of view, it is important for college student to have a part-time job. First of all, it is a good chance for student raise their ability of living in the society. As we all know, during the recent years, it is hard for some student who just left school to find a good job since the company do not admit they ability by a piece of paper since the education system is not trustful. At this time, if they show something they got in the part-time job, it would be very useful for them. Meanwhile, as a college student myself, I find that we have a lot of spare time after finishing the courses required, the part-time job in spare time can enlarge our abilities of communication, teamwork spirit and so on.   However, we should have a clear mind on the priority, as a student, the first mission is learning, part-time job can help us a lot, but if you failed a lot, you will still face many problems,. Beyond this, pay more attention with the contract when you what to sign in a part-time job. 
Different people hold different views on part-time jobs for college students. Although more and more people focus their attention on part-time jobs, I donÅft think we should do part-time jobs in college. We fell happy and proud that we go to the colleges we have long been dreaming for after great efforts. However we are faced with more challenges. The subjects we study are not easy to grasp. We also need to develop social relationships. Still, we need to take part in many competitions. Moreover, there are quite a lot of books lying in the library we need to go though. It is really a great opportunity for us to develop ourselves in all aspects. We are supplied with so many chances that we have no time to do part-time jobs. It would be better that we go out when we graduate. In conclusion, we should cherish the golden time in college for self-learning and self-developing. What the most important is that we would better keep busy every minute to make each day count in order to fulfill our dream and contribute to our society better. So do not do things that distract our attention from studying. Make better use of every day to make ourselves more and more independent powerful. 
As is known to us all, college is a place where people look for further education, exchange their academic ideas and finally both enrich their selves for their future career in society and propel the development of all endeavors of society. However, college is not equal to society. College students need opportunities to get in touch with those things beyond campus and accumulate enough practical experiences for their future careers. It is precisely the part-time job that gives such opportunities to college students. Serving in restaurants, working as an intern secretary for a company, or being a salesman selling commodities on short-term sale etc., no matter what part-time job a college student chooses to participate in, she will learn practical skills to adjust to society which academic-centered college cannot teach her. Besides, it should be taken into consideration that part-time jobs do offer a certain amount of money to college students, making some financial income for college studentsÅf daily life or even helping them to afford their college study. One of my high school classmates went to a college in Singapore for further education after his graduation, in the first year, his family offered his nearly $15,000 for study and living expense. Now he is in his senior year, with his part-time job income of nearly $250 per month on average, he will save at least $2,000 for his family when he get his bachelor degree. During the two yearsÅf part-time job, he not only gained money, but also learn things about making contract with a company, getting along with coworker, how a restaurant is arranged and run, etc. Hence, it is important to college students to have a part-time job. 
It is an interesting topic for us to discuss, and it is necessary for us to consider if we should do something in our spare time.  As a university student, I think it is important to have a part-time job. I have three reasons below. First of all, from primary school to now, it is our parents who are supporting us to study. We have not spent one coin, which is earned by ourselves. We are no longer children; we are adult now.  So we have the responsibility to support ourselves. To have a part-time job is a good choice.  Secondly, the life at college is not so busy that we donÅft have any spare time. As a matter of fact, we have leisure to do many things we like. You may spend time on computer games, or doing some reading, or learning some software or something else. Certainly, you can find a part-time job to make life full. At last, a part-time job is a job, we could gain experience in the process. We can learn how to work with others, how to adjust to different environment, how to do a plan for ourselves to have a brilliant future. It must be useful in the future life. In conclusion, I think it is important and helpful to have a part-time job. 
Is it a good thing for college students to work part-time jobs? I think there are many advantages for college students to have part-time jobs. Many teachers complain that there are fewer and fewer students who pay attention to their study because of part-time jobs. But in my opinion, students can choose to take up a part-time job according to their own situation. As we know, college students have fewer subjects and less pressure than high school. They have more time to do things they like. Having a part-time job is not a bad idea I think. Taking a part-time job has lots of advantages for college students. Firstly, part-time job offer them opportunities to apply what they have learned in school and demonstrate their abilities. Secondly, students can make some money through the part-time job, and it enables them to be more independent of their family and builds up their self-confidence. Thirdly, part-time experiences may be of great help to their future careers. Finally, part-time jobs can broaden their college lives and help them know more of themselves and society.  But the more important thing for them is to keep a good balance between part-time job and their study. On the condition, I agree with the opinion that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. 
 I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.  I think the part-time job is necessary for college students to have more chance to know the situation of themselves. If a college student only at school learns the knowledge he has to learn, he will never know the difficulty they would be in when they are in society.  There is a large number of students donÅft know the hardness of earning money. They use money without self-control. The money is from their parents, college students without their work they donÅft how much have to pay to earn money. If they have a part-time job, they will know the hardness of earning money, how much have to pay to earn money.   There are also many studentsÅf families are not so rich for them to go to college in China now.  The paid for go to college is a huge burden for their families. If they can have part-time jobs to earn money in the spare time of their studies, it will let their parents to feel more releasable. Also it can make many students to have more extra money to buy what they like.   For those reasons, I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. 
 I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Not for the payment, but the experience which we get from the work.   As a college student, though we learn a lot in class and take part in kinds of activities, the knowledge for working is far from enough. We even donÅft know copy the documents or make a schedule for others. Someone even donÅft have a consciousness of time ? no matter how the meeting is important, they are always late.    We hope to train ourselves, and of course, the companies also want the college students to have more ability. So if one has an experience just like a part-time job while studying, he/she will get a dominant position in the job-searching.   Somebody maybe say ÅgOK! We will train ourselves in the Student Union. ItÅfs a good place for learning and working.Åh I donÅft think so. Although we can learn a lot in the Student Union, for example, to write a program for the sports-meeting, the Student Union is not a company or the society. You are working, but with your classmates and in the campus.   These are the reasons why I believe that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. 
When we come to the college, almost every new student will be into the situation. Should our students to have a part-time job? In my opinion, itÅfs necessary to have a part-time job. Most of the students havenÅft ever leave home before entered the college. It seems that we are always in the protection of our parents. Therefore, we need to see and know the world by our own eyes. Having a part-time job can make us to attach the real world and society. It likes my father said, life is like a school. To be a student, we should not only learn knowledge form the text books but also from the life. Life is always your best teacher. WhatÅfs more, from the part-time job we also learn that itÅfs not so easy to earn money as we think. Mostly, whatÅfs we paid would be more than we earn. And if you want to be going further than others, you should arm yourselves better than others. That means you should know more and learn more. Within the job we increase our experiences as well. For example, what should we do when facing the emergency? How to do a work better? And I believe that it will be a warmly memory when we look back whenever it is. 
ItÅfs more and more popular for college students to take a part-time job nowadays. Personally I think it is important to do so.    First of all, taking a part-time job teaches us to be thrifty. As we can see, most of the college students tend to luxurious now. They buy clothes with famous brand which are quite expensive. I admit expensive clothes usually have good quality, but too expensive with famous brand ic unnecessary. While most of them seek for the famous brand rather than good quality . So itÅfs important to learn to be thrifty for us. Secondly, taking a part-time job can give us some good experience which will help us to get used to society. Though we have many activities in college, thatÅfs different from society after all . I took a part-time job as a waitress in a restaurant last term. I must be patient and considerate to all kinds of people. I also need to make the tables clean after they had meals. I learned hoe to hold dishes when I served them to the customs and many things else. I stopped the job because itÅfs a little tired and I was busy afterwards. But itÅfs a good experience. It taught me to be tolerant when getting along with people. Another thing is that taking a part-time job helps us earn some money. It can lighten the burden of our family, especially for the poor ones.       There are also many other advantages of part-time job, such as broadening our knowledge, strengthening our body and so on. So I think itÅfs important for college students to take a part-time job.  
In my opinion, it is important for college students to have a part-time job. If the college student can take the full use of the part time job, it can not only bring the salary but also can provide the chance of prove our social experience. College students are different from the high school or junior students. The aim we study in the college is to have a job, but not for enter the university as before. Social life has its own rule which is very different from the school, it is more complicate, more danger. So if we have no experience we will fell very puzzling when we graduated from university. Some people disagree with the idea who said that college students are easy to be tricked. But I think it is much better than be tricked when you graduated. On the other hand, be tricked is also an important course we have to learn before we enter the social, which is canÅft be learned from the courses we take in the school, but only can learn from the practice. Of course, all we talked is based on that your part time will not influence your normal studying. If you spend most time on part time job which make you canÅft educated, than except the money ,you can get nothing from the part time job and it just lost itÅfs real meaning. Balance is important for everything. 
As far as I am concerned, it is important for student to have a part-time job. My points are listed as follows. Firstly ,students in the school take classes in the campus everyday, so that they concentrate too much on the books in front of them ,leading to a fact that they do not know much about the society, which is by all means not good for them esp when they step into society .Having a part-time job help them to learn to work in a earlier time, to get along with people who have been working for some period of time and so on, all of which give them a closer view to society ,which is certainly a kind of good experience for them . Secondly, doing a part-time job make students have different points of views as they should deal with people from all walks of life .This can also gives them different respects to value things . Thirdly, they know better how to earn money and have a deeper understanding of how their parents brought them up, which also let them treasure the present life. So, it is important for student to have a part-time job.  
I donÅft think part-time job is important in college life.  First of all, as being a college student, we still have lots to learn and we have no idea what we are capable of. Because of this, we usually choose very simple and meaningless part-time jobs like waiters and cleansers. Truly we can earn some small pocket money through these jobs, but in the same time, the precious time that we lost just equals the value. In order to spare the time, I prefer to make a good use of the library which is definitely great treasure for us and we very likely wonÅft be able to have access to the large amount of knowledge any more. So why donÅft we treasure the time and the utilities now, so that we can arm ourselves with broad sight and knowledge.  About the working experience or the society experience, I think these are ought to be realized after graduation for we have plenty of time to deal with the society, like 5 decades or even more. IÅfm sure that at that moment, we must be very tired of work and always like to looking back to our campus life which should be pure, full of activities and enjoyment, maybe piles of books we have read which brings us wisdom, or maybe an unforgettable girlfriend or boyfriend. Whatever it is, it will never be the job.  Compared with the work time, school time is so short, I hope I can enjoy my school life to the largest extent and leave no regret! 
Is it important for college students to have a part-time job? ItÅfs becoming a controversial question recently as more and more college students do part-time job in their spare time.   Those people, who hold that having a part-time job is essential for college students, emphasize that through part-time jobs, students can learn professional knowledge better. For example, the student who is major in computer takes a part-time job in a computer company, he can learn the knowledge that doesnÅft exist in books and at the same time he can realize thereÅfs still a lot to learn so that he works harder and harder. WhatÅfs more, the part-time job provides them with experiences that canÅft be taught in a lecture hall. They think that the knowledge learn from schools is insufficient. So it is helpful to attend this kind of social life to get social knowledge. It seems that part-time jobs act as warm-up exercises for students to take full-time jobs after they graduate, and help them prepare for their future careers. The students who have the experiences in part-time jobs will be more competitive when they find job. Last but not least, the part-time job can offer the students whose families have financial problems enough money so that they can study until graduating from college.  Others, on the contrary, will of course opposite and, they believe that the most important thing for student is study. They argue that college students are too young to face up with the complex society and itÅfs also a waste of time. According to me, the benefits will certainly outdo the drawbacks. However, it depends on you .If you can deal the relationship between working and learning well, IÅfm sure that you can succeed in the end. 
 From my point of view, I partly agree with the point that college student should have a part?time job.   College is a very important step before enter the society. University and the society is very similar, you must learn some practical life skills in the university. But the fact is that you can`t learn such skills in the textbooks in the university.   I think in the university, we have more time to do something we really want to do, so why not try to seek for the chance, and do a part?time job? That will really benefit to us.   Though a part?time job is not a official wok, it still quite difficult for those unexperienced. You will learn how to treat people, how to deal with the problems, also some troubles we have never met before. For us, it means enter the society ahead of time. It is beneficial.   But everything has two sides, do a part?time job also has its disadvantage, if you can`t balance the relation between study and work, it will influence your studyÅBAfter all, I think the advantages are bigger than the disadvantages. So the college students should have a part?time job. 
Now many college students have part-time job .I think it is important for us because we can not only learn at school . We must go out of school to know other things that we can not learn from school . Part-time job is the good way to do this .From part-time job we can learn the way   to communicate with others ,not just with classmates . From part-time job we can know many people who maybe can help ourselves at other way .From part-time job we also can learn the difficult that happens in the future . Although part-time job maybe can costs our study time , it is worth to do this ,I think . What is more , Part-time job also can help the student whose family have not much money to support a student to go to college . Doing a part-time job can make some money to support the study . I did a part-time job last term and it helped me much, not for the money but the experience that can help me all the time between my college time so I think a part-time job is important for college students . All above is my opinion . That is all . 
Should students do a part-time job or not differs from different students in different countries. Of course ,doing a part-time job is good for students to build more abilities not only about the knowledge in the textbook. But for me, I donÅft think is good to do the part-time jobs. I have got a lot to do within my lessons, I really have no more time to spend on other jobs, even though I know it clearly that doing such a job is good to me. If I spend my time that should be spent doing my lessons, I think the result would be that neither I learn what I should learn in the textbook, and neither will I gin a ability that should be built by doing the part-time job, because I canÅft do the two things with my full heart.]   So if you have a lot of free time I suggest you to do a part-time job, selecting a job that fit to you is very important, in my opinion the best is the ones have confections with your subject in school. If you really have got a lot of works to deal with, itÅfs better to spend all your efforts in your own studying, not even thinking about searching a part-time job, for that you can learn most things in the shortest time in school,  at least I think so. 
Yes, I think so. Since we are now college students, it means not only studying hard, but also ÅgworkingÅh hard. After graduating from the college, we are to step into the society. If we donÅft have any experience about how to work well, how can we live on? Having a part-time job just means getting more experience about the job and the society. At the same time, we can make money for our everyday life, and save money from our parents. That will make our parents happy.  As is known for all, having a part-time job requires us to balance study and part-time job well. That can practice our management skill of time. Saving more time means living longer. If we can manage our time well, we can have a much more efficient life.  Moreover, we can practice our communication skill. Nowadays, the level of communication skill leads to the level of your success. If we can communicate with others well, we can make many friends, and they can help us when needed. With the help from our friends, we can succeed more easily than on our own.  So, I agree with college students having a part-time job. 
 When I was a high school student, I was always dreaming about my colorful college life. In my eyes, college students should make the best use of the time to experience different things. Of course, I cannot miss part-time job.  I do believe that we can benefit from doing a part-time job and my opinion is based on the following reasons.  Firstly, it is said that the campuses are much purer than the society and we college students lack society experience. According to this fact, the most important point of part-time job is gaining experience so that we can get ourselves prepared for the jobs in the future.      Besides, we learn to how to deal with others through doing part-time jobs. We will be aware of customsÅf need and learn to use what we have learnt to fulfillment their requirement.  The last but not the most least is that we can earn some pocket money to buy something we are longing for, to give our parents a surprise that we are no longer children. WhatÅfs more, as earning money is no easy, we will realize the importance of money and learn to use money more correctly. Do a part-time job to larger our vision, to improve ourselves, to make our college life more colorful. 
It is important for college students to have a part-time job I do agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Lack of money may be the most import reason for us college students to search for a part-time job as we knew. For some students it is the part-time job that provides them with the fundamental cost of living. And it will make it possible to start a life without parentsÅf financial aid although we should have been self-reliable in as an adult. It is true that thinking of the hardship we will consider fully before we spend the money made by ourselves. Moreover, as college students, aside from academic knowledge, we should gain more experience through those part-time job. I had a part-time job of teaching a high school student math one year ago. At weekends, I should wake up early to take the first bus while my roommates were enjoying the beautiful dreams. But being paid for 30 RMB per hour, I did obtain a sense of achievements through this part-time job. I think what we gain through part-time jobs is not only the money but also the particular experience after hard working. I think the college life will lack color if we live out four years in college without doing a part-time job.  
 This is a discussion about if it is right for college students to have a part-time job. Some students think that it is important for us have the chance to have a part-time job to broaden our view. However, there is still some students think that it is no need for us using time and energy to have a part-time job.  In my opinion, I think that it is very important for us college students to have a part-time job. Firstly, having a part-time job can help us make good use of our time. Because most of us use our time on playing computer games or playing with friends after class. Secondly ,having a part-time job can give us more experience. It will make us college students more confident and mature for future . Besides, having a part-time also can make some money, can't it ? We can use the money we make buy some things we need. For example , the professional books or tools . What's more, we can live easier with the money.  In one word, I agree with the students who think that it is important for college students to have a part-time . And it is the time for us to take a action!   
I thinkÅCas a university student ÅCif we have the chanceÅCwe should take a part-time jobÅBThe reasons are as followsÅB Firstly ÅCwe can earn some money so that parents` burden can be reduced ÅBThough it is not too much ÅCour parents can know that we understand their pressure and that we are trying our best to do all that we can ÅBour parents will feel happy to see thisÅB SecondlyÅCif we work as a teacher in your part-time job ÅCwe can review what we have learnedÅBOur students and we ourselves can promote at the same time ÅCwhich we may be not realize until we have made progress obviouslyÅB ThirdlyÅCwe can get the ability to communicate with people in societyÅCwhich is very important when we work in companies in future ÅBsince we are studentsÅCwe get along only with students every dayÅBAs a result ÅCwhen many graduates enter the society ÅCthey cannot adjust to the difficulties and challenges at the beginning ÅCbut if we have taken part-time jobs ÅCmaybe it can be avoidedÅB HoweverÅCmany students hold the opinion that taking a part-time job may waste our time ÅCAs a studentsÅCwhat is the most important is studyingÅCwe can earn money after we have graduatedÅBIn my opinionÅCtaking a part-time job does not mean that we are wasting our studying time ÅBBecause it depends on the way you arrange your time ÅBAs a college student ÅCwe should have the ability to make our time to be full usedÅB CertainlyÅCeveryone has their own opinion on the topicÅCjust do what you think is right. 
Many people think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job, because the students can not only earn money by themselves but also can learn something which they couldnÅft learn in the school. At the same time some other people insist that students should stay in the school to study the knowledge.  In my opinion, I agree that the students in college should have a part-time job. Because there is more knowledge which can not be learned from the textbooks. If a student wants to fail less, then what he needs is not only the knowledge which he learns from schools. Maybe study the knowledge from the books well is important, but the knowledge which can be learned from the society is necessary. Some people may think that it is a waste to have a part-time job for the college students. However, if a student only knows the knowledge that he learns from the books, he may lost more in the future. 
As far as a qualified modern college student is concerned, I approve of the opinion that It is important for college students to have a part time job. From my point of view, it can not only relief our parentsÅf burden but also enable us to make good preparation for our social life in the future. It is well known that the campus is called Ågivory towerÅh, and it is also very obvious that students should pay most of their attention on their professional knowledge. But on the other hand, college students in modern time should also have a good knowledge of the world outside. And a part-time job is just a good chance to contact the society and learn more practical things that canÅft be learned at school. For example, as for me, I am doing a part time job as a private teacher. I think it can offer me some money to do whatever I want without ask my mother. And whatÅfs more important is that through the part-time job, I have learned how to balance my study and other things batter. I also learned how to get well with different kinds of people. I also did other kinds of part-time before.        I learned much from my experience and these are all prepare for my future work.  There is no doubt that a part-time job can offer us the chance to know the world outside better which may awaken in us a high sense of duty and help us make greater achievement in the future. Therefore, I think it is important for college students to have a part time job. 
  As a matter of fact, IÅfm just doing a part time job as a fraulein now at weekends. I also get some money from it and feel very happy, because it is the first money I got by myself. As a fraulein, I must face with many kinds of people. I think it is the thing that is impossible to avoid.   But in China, there are very little part time jobs for our students. I know, in Japan, university students can do part time jobs not only as a fraulein but also as a waiter, a librarian, even a cook and so on. I think it is the reason why the students in Japan are morn self-support than our Chinese students. In China, many students donÅft want to do part time jobs because they think it can make them lose countenance. But I donÅft think so. I think do part time jobs can make our students step into the society, then we will know the importance of study. Knowledge can make us richer than only do jobs with our hands.   So I think do part time jobs are very necessary for our university students. I also want to do many kinds of part time jobs to make myself much stronger. 
In my opinion, it is not important for college students to have a part-time job. Firstly , Chinese students are always busy with their studies. Even though they have gone to college , they still have many lessons. A part-time job will take our time that should be used for studying. We may not do our homework well. So, it begins at the wrong end.  Secondly, a part-time job will cost the physical power. If we are tired, we may fall asleep easily on class. Over fatigue are not only bad for our study, but also bad for our health. Thirdly, if we have a part-time job, we may see many new people and many different things. All these will hold our mind. Even on class, our mind may sneak away. Of course many people think that part-time jobs can make college students become independent, strengthen our communication ability. But, whenever, the good score is the precondition for a good job. So if we really want to experience a part-time job, it is better to wait until we turn to grade four, when we are not busy with studying any more. 
I agree with that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. First,college is a place not only for us to learn our major,but also a place to learn how to make a life in the future.The experance of working is very important.Because it can let us know how to deal with kinds of troubles when we step into the society. Second,to have a part job means we can earn some money.Though it is not a large income,we can know the hardness to earn money.I suppose that many of the Chinese college stuents spent too much money on unnesscery things, just because they get money only from their parents. But in my opinion,not all the part-time job are fit for us.If we choose the job which take us too mach time,it will do bad to our studies.The most important thing for our college students,as all know,is studies.So I preffer the job take me two or three times a week,and every time one or two hours. Every coin has two sides.What we should do is to find a balance between studies and part-time job. 
I think it is not very important for college students to have a part-time job. First, the most important duty of students is to learn knowledge. We go to school for knowledge, isnÅft it? If we have a part-job, maybe it will have a bad influence on our study. Because part-time job will spend some pieces of time. Second, what can we get from a part-time job? I think most people will say ,money and experience. Yeah, we can get experience, but the studentsÅf work in school also can give us that. I think the only reason of a part-time job is money. If you are quite lack of money, youÅfd better to have one. If you just want to have a try, maybe one time is enough. To most of students, a part-time job is a tool to earn money, but I think in this time, the most important thing is to improve ourselves, to get knowledge and make friends with our schoolmates, but not to make ourselves rich. However, maybe this is different in different countries.  So, I think, it is not very important for college students to have a part-time job. 
I think it is important for a college-student to support a part-time job. Maybe someone will say Ågyou must do what student should to do, as a student, the only work you need to you is to study.Åh  But I think this opinion is not completely right, why? As a college-student, we have already been adults, we have the ability to keep ourselves, although we need to study, we donÅft have so much time for part-time job , but little is forever better than nothing . We can do some simple part-time jobs, although the salary is too poor to keep our life, with this money we can reduce pressure of our parents. And the most important reason is the part-time job can make us to know the society, nowadays collage-students have few chances to know the society , when they graduate from collage and enter in the society , they will feel anxious . Part-time job can make you know how to live in the society, and let you know how to make communications with other people. these are very important for us to live in the society.    Take a little time, and get you much advantage, go to search for a part-time job. 
Nowadays, more and more students are doing part-time work. But different people hold different opinion .I think students working part time usually have a positive effect on them. For instance, it helps him to realize that no success comes from nothing. It enables him to be independent and builds up his self-confidence. WhatÅfs more, part-time jobs can get the students out of the ivory tower and give them the opportunity to get along with different kinds of people ,get useful working experiences and learn the value of labor. Besides earning some money to support themselves, they can learn a lot which cannot be learned from textbooks. As everything has two sides, the disadvantages can't be ignored. Part-time jobs cut into students' study time; some even become so occupied with making money that they canÅft focus their attention on studying. In the end, these students may fall behind or fail in their studies.        In my opinion, students can choose to take up a job according to their own situation. The most important thing is for him to keep a good balance. 
I donÅft think it is very important for our college students to have a part-time job. Part-time job, in my opinion ,is just one of the small pieces in college life, maybe it helps us to know how difficult it is to make a life in modern life, and make us work hard. but it also waste a lot of our time, which should be used in studying.  Our parents live a hard life to offer tuition fee to us, so we have the duty to do our work well. ItÅfs true that college is the place for us to enjoy our lives, we canÅft spend all our youth to study, we can take part in many activities to make new friends, and take a job. But we should never forget that study should always come first. Without good results, nothing is meaningful.  I canÅft deny all the students who take part-time jobs. The students whose family havenÅft got the ability to offer the tuition had to work to continue his study. But the students whose families have enough money for you to use should focus your attention on study. Now even you go to find a job, without technology, you can only find a low income job, which have nothing to do with what you have learned.  
In my opinion, It is important for college students to have a part-time job. For college students there is much spare timeÅBIt is unreasonable for them to use all their spare time on playing games especially computer gamesÅB It is sensible to have a part time job for college studentsÅBFor one thingÅChaving a part time job can help us know more about our societyÅBWe can learn a lot from our part time jobÅCsuch as how to communicate with others well and what we need that can help us do the work wellÅBAll of thisÅCyou can not learn when you always stay at campus and read your booksÅBFor another thingÅChaving a part time job can keep us healthyÅBWhyÅHnow studentsÅf mental health is becoming a problemÅBStudents often feel lonely if they have nothing to do expect for studyingÅBThey will become ill in mental easily if they can not manage time wellÅBHaving a part time job is a good idea because it can enrich our spare timeÅBFinally having a part time job can help us make some money so that we will not have to depend on our parents for living expense .even we can pay tuition fee by ourselves . Having a part time can make our college live more brilliant.   
I agree with the point that it is important for college students to have part-time jobs. In China, there are quite a large number of students cannot afford their tuition. For the reason of attending college and daily life, sometimes they have to find one or more part-time jobs. Of course, there are still large numbers of students have no problem with money. But I think for them, taking a job doesnÅft mean to earn money but to earn more experience. College is just like a small society. Having a part-time job at college can help us enter the society easier. And I think only when we start to make money we realize the difficulty in it. We know for our parents making money is not that easy too. We are adults now and we should act as an adult. Even though having a part-time job can benefit us a lot, we still should pay attention to it. Firstly, itÅfs important to choose a job fit for us. Say we are now at collage and we canÅft spent all day at the work. WhatÅfs more, we mustnÅft forget our study. Make sure our study is developing smoothly and then we can spent sometime at the job. I think most collage students may have the experience of taking a part-time job, maybe long or short, maybe one kind or many kinds of. I indeed appreciate my part-time job as a family-teacher. Being a student for so many years, itÅfs cool to sometimes become a teacher! 
At present, more and more university students are doing part-time jobs, they work as family tutors, waiters, salesmen and so on. Like everything else, having a part-time have both favorable and unfavorable aspects. The advantages can be listed as follows. First, through have a part-time job the students can have the chance of earning pocket money and this can reduce their parentsÅf financial burden. In addition, they can put what they have experience and get to know the society. For example, they can learn to get along with people. ThatÅfs canÅft be learnt from books.    But every coin has two sides, the disadvantages of having a part-time job are also apparent. some students think that Part-time job may take up too much time and energy, and may influence their study.   As to me, I believe the positive aspects outweigh the negative ones, because when we are college students, we have much time which can be used by ourselves, I think have a part-time job will more useful then to use this time to sleep or play computer games. Also the experience which have through the part-time job will be very useful when we enter in the society. Therefore, students can benefit from their part-time job so long as they can keep a good balance between study and work. 
There is a general debate on the campus recently over the phenomenon of college students` doing a part-time job, which also has been widely concerned by the public. Without any doubt, engaging in a part-time job will goes a long way to college students who have been educated by Chinese style education and have narrow knowledge of the society. The majority of the students believe that by taking a part-time job they can not only improve their academic studies but also gain much experience such as interpersonal skills which may put them in a favorable position in the future job markets. And in my opinion a proper part-time job would not occupy students too much time. In the other hand spending all the time on study in the room is not a wise choice. The last but not the most important, college students should have the conscious of relieving the pressure of family .Of course doing a part-time job is the best way. Everything has both positive and negative aspects, and students` doing a part-time job is of no exception. There is some students canÅft manage time well and that will cause problems of filature in concentrating on study. Another serious resistance is that most parents think the society today is too complicated for the college students to adjust to and what is more, we may be cheated. So I suggest that the government should set out a series of laws to norm the part-time job markets and to protect students rights.  From what has been discussed above, I draw a conclusion that part-job ,which seems not the most proper and reasonable nowadays ,can product many benefits to college students and our future, should be encouraged. 
In my opinion, the part-time job is beneficial to a college student. Doing part-time job, they can earn money by themselves, know more about the difficulties of making money, gain some experience and become more independent.   While there are some problems. The first problem is time. As students of Japanese department, most of us get up at six, in order to read Japanese text and then study till midnight every day, even on Saturday and Sunday. So up to now, only two students take a part-time job in our class.   Though the part-time job is beneficial, the role it plays in our campus life is not very important. I even can't feel my sister's change after she did the part-time job when she was a college student. And now she is more pleased to see that I pay more attention to the Japanese and English than doing a part-time job. If someone want to lighten the economic burden by doing part-time jobs, it needs a lot of time .Because a little work doesn't work. Maybe work hard for the scholarship is more efficient.   Do you think my view is opposite to the first one? I just want to say in the theory, the part-time job is beneficial; in the fact, it doesn't make much difference and needs time.   For myself, If I won't be so busy in the second or third year in the college, I am glad to do a part-time job, but not must to. 
When it comes to college studentsÅf part-time jobs, people will hold different opinions on it. Although some people believe it is not necessary for college students to do part-time jobs, I think it helpful for us. There are some factors supporting my point. Doing part-time job is what can improve our ability including working ability and living ability. Besides, in this way we can step on the society earlier, touch different people and experience different things, which is contributed to open and enlarge our field and vision. In addition ,we can also earn money which allows us to do what we want. However, there are also some disadvantages in it. For example , it will take a lot of time which should be spent on study. So we must deal with the part-time job and the studyÅfs relation. WhatÅfs worse, we also may be taken in by some evildoers. So it is necessary for us to improve our alert. If We can do as this, we will gain many meaningful things from it Taking into account all these features, I believe deep that it is important for us colleges to do part-time job.  
I donÅft agree with the statement that itÅfs important for a college student to have a part-time job. It is not a matter of money, but a matter of ability. Being an 18 or 19-year-old student, the knowledge we have gained from their study already enables us to take in some kinds of work, such as being a private teacher, a waiter and so on. What we are lack of is the opportunities to develop or practice our potential. Only by having a try, can we really get more experiences that will assess us in the future job. , And a part-time job offers us such a valuable stage.  Since we have been a college student, study should not fill our life as usual, we have so much spare time that we should make full use of them to do some meaningful things, and a part-work is a good choice.   By making money by ourselves, will we value our parentsÅf endeavor more, and be confident and independent more, no matter we are in a rich family or poor. Also, though the social practice, what we get is not only money, but another fresh attitude towards the society and work, which we can never learn from any book. ThereÅfs no doubt that we will encounter a lot of difficulties in the part-time job, for example, how to balance the time between study and work, at the beginning maybe itÅfs a problem, but as time goes on, you can be a master of time, you will be more and more efficient, which is really important in our high-speed developing society. All in all, a part-time job is really of great importance. 
In my eyes, it is not important for collage students to have a part-time job.    First, we donÅft short of money. No matter wealth or poor, our parents are able to support us to go to university .Also; it is their responsibility to do this. So at this point, we have no reason to make money by ourselves. Having a part-time job, some students only want to buy present for their girlfriends or boyfriends, or just in order to have a new PSP.    Second, as we know, we are students, we have the severe competition and are admitted to the university which we like, and our aims are to get a good further education. It is also our relatives want us to do. But we waste our time on the part-time job, I think is not worthy. Though a little progress we will make, we are unable to take a big jump in the future. Putting into a lot of energy, the time we used to study is very short.    Last but not the least important is that we cannot make sure whether it is safe for a part-time job. A lot of newspapers have reported such news as like students are killed because of the part-time job.  
      I think the first professional is knowledge, social jobs and skills are the second point.      We are STUDENTS, not workers or so on. To have a good job, first of all, we should have good structure of the knowledge.       Students must have the basic skills of learning, so that we can plan our own future for our lives better .To take full advantage of opportunity, college students should study hard instead of working. Only to learn can we meet the greater challenges.       A famous philosopher once said: Giving fishing skills to someone is far more better than giving fish to him. Working in college can just earn money, but if you study well, you can earn more and more.     That is my opinion of this subject. 
There are still so many people discussing about this topic whether it is important for a collage student to find a part-job.     Because in some peopleÅfs opinion, the students who have find a fit job can alleviate the financial burden on the family. But the others think it is a waste of time to do so, because studentsÅf most important duty is study. They should care there expertise first. My view is that it free for the collage students whether they should do so. It depends on studentsÅf self-condition. At first time limit is a big problem in front of the part-job. Because some studentsÅf courses need a lot of time to study, such as languages. It is not reality for them to find a part-job. Then some of the studentsÅfs family conditions are not good enough to supply their live. So it is necessary for them to find a job so that they can live better and mitigate their parentÅfs pressure. The last point, there are still so many students who both have time and a good live condition and they also  want to improve themselves .so they could do a part-job to promote their ability and social experience.   Some people say that the times of university is the best in a personÅfs whole life. So we should plan well and enjoy the youth with the whole heart. 
I donÅft think so.To find a part-time job maybe helpful, howere, honestly speaking it is not helpful to many college students . First of all,taking part-time jobs may take much of our time which should have been used in study.To most of we students the most important thing is getting as much knowledge as possible before graduating .What an employer wants is the knowledge you have not how much you have earned in your part-time job. Second,in grade 4,colleges will provide us opportunities to take practice.We can learn experienses, money and all we need to prepare at that time.At that time we will be better prepared than before. Third,since we live in such a country that have a huge number of people,the amount of the work that is able to do is limited.If we all want to get a part-time job then how many chances will leave those who really need a job to survive. What can those people do? Then what will our country be like? In conclusion,I think it unnecessary for a college students to find a part-time job.It is not helpful for himself and also not good to other people, further more not good to the society. It is better to do the right thing at the right time. 
It is important for college students to have a part-time job    Being college students means we are not children any more and we already have the ability to support ourselves. However,  infact , almost everyone of us students in China  depends on our parents which leads to a phenomenon that parents work hard and children play hard.   In my opinion, it is important for college students to have a part-time job. not only can we enjoy the pleasure of earning money, but we can get to know the hardship of life so that we can hard work and appreciate it. Beside, having a part-job can provide us a chance to acquaint ourselves with society.   Nevertheless, there are also many persons standing for the idea that a part-time job is a waste of time because studying is the important  job for a student. For this ,I have to say they are wrong .Taking a job is not a waste of time ,on the contrary ,it can teach us how to use time in a proper way.   We may meet a lot of problem while doing the job .That is not the problem. For all pain helps to make us rise, however much we may hate it at the time What is more, we are young and we have the courage to conquer them. The job may bring us more pains than happiness, but it is really a treasure that will bring us more opportunities in the future. We have to pay the price if we want to win.   In a word, we can benefit a lot from a part-time job. Please remember the sentence: Knowledge comes from experience alone. 
I agree with the statement that itÅfs important for college students to have a part-time job.  First of all, in modern society, college students are facing bigger and bigger pressure on job hurting. Almost all the companies are tending to employ staffs with working experiences even for the new graduates. In order to find a job, college students need working experiences. During college, students are old enough to be hired; college study is not as busy as lower level education, too. This is really a good time to start working.  Meanwhile, college students get paid by part-time jobs; this will also lighten the financial pressure from the parents.  With the income students can spend more money on there interests, which may have positive effects to their lives.  At last, there must be a lot of differs between campus life and society. By part-time jobs, students will learn how to communicate with different people, how to face failure and challenges, which can never be taught in campuses. Students with part-time jobs will know the society earlier and better. This will make them brave, responsible and grown-up.  So I think itÅfs very important for college students to have a part-time job. And I hope the society and companies will provide more part-time positions. 
When asked about it id important for college students to have a part-time job.Å@Some people disagree this view. They think a part-time job waste many time for students to study at school.Å@Another people hold this view .     In my opinion, I believe it is important for college students to have a part-time job. This reasons for my choice are listed as follows. In the first place, with the development of society, company need a experienced employer. But college students lack a practice when they graduated from school. At college they learn acknowledge is not useful to future work..It is not link to work. They find it is very difficult to find a job. In the second place, college students have a pare-time job could get some money to reduce family pressure. They could learn the values of money when they get money by yourself. They will cherish money because of they find it is not easy to get money.     Though the above analysis. I think college students will be benefit from a part-time job. Whatever effects it has, one thing is certain, it have more positive effects than negative effects to college students. In a word, a part-time will help college students to have a chance to practice and have a better future. 
Some people maintain that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China. In their opinion, smoking is harmful not only to the smokers but also to the people around. WhatÅfs more, smoking is a waste of money, because of no advantage. When one smokes a cigarette, one is actually burning money. The smokers do not agree. They believe that smoking can helps to sharpen their mind and prevents one from sleeping, especially when they are working on a hard work. Also, the government gets lots of money from cigarette taxes, and these money can help us to make our country better. I am not a smoker, and I donÅft like smoking very much. But, I argue that the smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants. ItÅfs not realistic for preventing every smoker from smoking. As we all known, everyone has his right to choose the style of life by himself. And, of course, no one has the right to impose his way on other people. So, in my view, the smoking should be banned in all the restaurants but not completely. In other words, we should give multiple choices to persons. In some areas of restaurants smoking should be allowed, and if you are not a smoker or you donÅft like smoking, you can choose the no-smoke-area of restaurants.  
We do know that smoking does a lot of harm to our health. Every year, millions of people die of lung cancers due to smoking. Smoking is damaging people every day. Yet, smoking should not be banded completely at all the restaurants in China. My views are as follows.   Things that exist must have values. In ChinaÅfs long history, smoking dates back to centuries ago. There must be reasons why so many people smoke. Smoking can make people have a good break after exhausting physical work. Also, many women say that they feel safe when they smoke. Artists say that they have flash ideas when they smoke. Writers also say they can not write down any word without smoking. Many people also have the habit of smoking during meals. If people can not drop the habit, why not produce cigarettes with higher qualities? It will be harmless of they donÅft breathe in the toxic nicotine. Smoking should be reduced but not banned completely. Many people say they can not do anything without cigarettes. Thus, it will not be a good idea to ban smoking. People who smoke during meals will feel that nothing is tasty if they are banned smoking. It would be better that we accept that fact and think of ways to solve the problem.   In summary, banning smoking is not the only way to solve problems. Change an angle to think. Producing better and healthier cigarettes way be of vital importance. 
With the process of human's adventure, the cigarette walked into ours life. Smoking has become a habit that being discuss for a long time. As we all know, cigarette contends varies kinds of drugs that do harm to our health, and the man who addicts in smoking has a clear mind on how badly does the cigarette affect people's life. However, there is a discussion held by some people that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in china.   To my own point of view, I strongly hold the opinion that smoking should be banned in all the public place. For starters, cigarette does not only do harm to the smoker's body, the smoke when the cigarette burning contends nearly all the poisons that the cigarette has, if you smoke in the public area like restaurant, the smoke would affect other person's health who don't smoke at all! At the same time, the smell of the smoke may make the surrounding clients feel uncomfortable. Furthermore, teenagers do not have a formed standard, they do not have a clear thought on what is good or not. If they thought it is cool smoking outside, they may firm the habit that they could not easily get rid of it since they are children.   Therefore, I it is necessary for our country to banned smoking in the public like restaurant. And my suggestion is that smoking is a bad habit which do harm to both you and other surrounders, try to get rid of it.   
More and more people pick up smoking nowadays. People smoke for different reasons. Most of them smoke because of fierce competition. As far as I am concerned, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in China. As is known to all, smoking is really dangerous. It is toxic and does harm to peopleÅfs lung damagingly. It not only does harm to those who smoke but also does harm to people surrounding. Moreover, people who smoke will be addicted to it gradually and it is really difficult to drop the habit. If people smoke at the restaurants, we will not have a good atmosphere to have meals. We can not imagine how scary it would be that the air would not be clear any longer but full of smoke. We will feel that the food would not be tasty any more. That would only lead to cough. Thus, in order to have a better environment for the public, there should be no smoking at the restaurants.   To sum up, smoking is of no use. Those who are addicted to it would better kick it out as soon as possible just for you and for the public. 
In my opinion, all restaurants in China should not completely ban smoking. Instead, it is necessary for most restaurants to set a smoking area to serve smokers and other restaurants to completely ban smoking. Although the majority of people support the assertion that smoking is harmful to smokers and people near them, in reality, there are still great amount of people in China who are smokers. Once all restaurants begin to ban smoking, smokers cannot stand the period in restaurants without any cigarettes. As a result, it is possible that large groups of heavy smokers give up to eat in restaurants and instead begin to eat at home or buy fast food, which will course great reduction of restaurantsÅf profits. Thus to look round the corner, it is reasonable for restaurants to divide themselves into smoking area and non-smoking area, then smokers could enjoy their cigarettes after finishing their delicious dinner without complaint from non-smokers while non-smokers could appreciate their dinner without smoky air. As I know, the ÅgShow CoffeeÅh is among those restaurants which first begin to set smoking area and non-smoking area in China, which is largely welcomed by its customers. In addition, there are special restaurants with limited room for the division of different areas. Under this situation, all the customersÅf health is much more important that the smokersÅf addiction, so runners of those restaurants should completely ban smoking without any hesitation.
In my opinion, thereÅfs no necessary to ban smoking completely. It is known to all that it is not polite and appropriate to smoke in some public occasion. However, it is impossible to ban smoking completely at all the restaurants. Firstly, China has a long history of growing tobacco, so smoking also last for a long time in China. Smoking become a way of communication when people talk to each other, just as drinking, though both of them are not good to health. People have be accustomed to this way, and can not change the custom in a short time?a few years or tens of years. Secondly, restaurants are places for people to eat, and to smoke a cigarette after meal is most smokersÅf habit. We can not stop them doing this because that is their freedom. On the other hand, smoking may affect othersÅf health, and that is why many people object smoking at restaurants. At this time, what we could do is to persuade them not to smoke, but we don not have the right to ban them.  Thirdly, the solution of avoid smoking at restaurants may not be banning, it can be other ways. For example, the public dinning hall can be divided into two parts, one for smokers and the other for non-smokers. In that way, every one can enjoy his dinner. Anyway, I think smoking should not be banned completely at all the restaurants in China.Å@ 
As everyone knows, cigarette is not perfect goods for people's health. However, many people smoke in a few places, for example bars or restaurant, where they will have an effective communication. I do think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China. The most important reason is that it does make other people ill because they are breathing it in and smoking can deeply damage peopleÅfs health even if they donÅft smoke. Firstly, smoking is the main reason for cancers. The more people smoke the shorter the can live. It could say smoking is the chief criminal of goods which will kill people. Secondly, it is also damage people who donÅft smoke. Restaurants are public place where full of people who donÅft smoke such as children and the old. If someone smokes at the restaurant, it actually changes the atmosphere of those places. No doubt smoking is very danger to our body, and especially it is more harmful to them who donÅft smoke but breathing smoke in.    In a condition it is a must to completely ban smoking at all the restaurants in China for us and our next generation. 
 I agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China.    As long as the Olympic Games was being holden in Beijing , smoking has been completely banned at all the restaurants in China. It is a truth that we all know that it is harmful for us if we smoke. And it is not only harmful for who smokes, it is also harmful for the people who are around the smoker. We go to restaurants to have dinner, not be like to let ourselves to be controlled in the harm of second smoking. Everyone have the right to let himself be in a good environment to enjoy dinner.    As we all know, such as England and France, many countries have been published the law that smoking should be banned in public place. I think the banned of smoking is one of a typical of the degree of a countryÅfs development. China is fast developing now, every one should have a good behave in the public place. As long as we know it is harmful to everyone if someone smokes in a public place, it is good to be completely banned in restaurants. 
 I agree with the statement that Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China. Because I myself am one of the sufferers.   As we all know, smoking is not only harmful to the smoker but also the others around. So we have no-smoking coach on the train and no-smoking cabin on the plane. Why not the restaurants?   Someone maybe say ÅgYes, we have the no-smoking restaurants. DonÅft like the smoke? Please go there. It is not necessary to ban smoking at all the restaurants. Åh In my opinion, nobody has the right to harm other peopleÅfs health, but the law has the power to protect everyoneÅfs health. If you would like to smoke, please smoke outside or back to home, donÅft disturb others.  ThatÅfs why smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants.  
ItÅfs easily to see the scene that someone who smokes in the public places many years ago. And now we can also see it happens in some restaurants. I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. To be honest, I hate smoking. It makes the air hardly to breathe and hurt not only the smoker but also the people who are just nearby. It isnÅft healthy to smoke too much often. Many people who smoke so badly that even get a cancer.  Can you image a restaurant which is filled with the smoke when you just open the door? Do you want to have a meal at there any more? ItÅfs easily to see the answers .And if there is a baby who is taken there by his parents, how badly it is. Most women donÅft like smoke and they also donÅft like others smoke before them. If you want to have a good impression on them, smoke is the worst choice. TO ban the smoking is not just be good for the manÅfs healthy, but also for the environment. We will have a happy time as we are have the healthy air in the restaurants. How nice it is! 
Doctors suggest that smoking is definitely bad for human health, not only for the people who smoke, but also for someone who is beside them. Smoking has been banned in many places, but I donÅft think it should be banned at all the restaurants in China.       That is because I think itÅfs unnecessary to do so. Actually there is few people smoking in restaurants, and if they want to smoke, they will go outside. ItÅfs probably because they will feel uneasy if the taste of the dishes become strange or not delicious for their reasons. On the other hand, it is a little unfair to deprive their rights to smoke at all places. Most restaurants have separated rooms today. If people smoke in restaurants, they canÅft be in a hurry, and if so they would like to choose a separated room rather than to stay in the lobby. So they wonÅft pollute the whole air of the restaurant. As to the small room where they stay, there is likely someone who fond of smoking like them. It really doesnÅft matter that much. People who smoke just canÅft help to smoking sometimes. If we donÅft allow them to smoke they will feel very uncomfortable. Restaurant is different from any other public places. They can avoid or decrease the time to go to other public places. For example, smoking is banned at railway stations, they can go to the waiting room later so that they need not to smoke before they get on. But no one can avoid going to restaurants. Everybody need to have meals everyday. This kind of restrictions will trouble them a lot.        Above all, I donÅft think itÅfs necessary to ban smoking at all the restaurants in China. 
I donÅft think that smoking should be banned at all the restaurant in China. In my opinion, when we want to do something, first we should plan it and then do it step by step. The present situation of Chinese restaurant is that these even no smoking area or smoking banned area. And on the other hand, it doesnÅft necessary to banned smoking at all the restaurant if there has smoking section and smoking banned section. And chinaÅfs population is so large that among them the smoking people is not a small number. The amount of restaurant in china is unimagined. To ban smoking at all the restaurant is a real risk.  
As far as I am concerned, smoking should be banned in all the restaurants in China . Smoking produces bad smell .If smoking is allowed in the restaurants ,guests would feel disgusting and the wall in the room is easy to become yellowish ,which is bound to have a bad effect on the business because almost all the customers esp. the would prefer the non-smoking places to have a meal instead of where smoking smell are filled . Some may hold the view that the banning may be makes some people reluctant to enter the restaurants ,but I donÅft think it is true .Customers would not refuse to keep themselves from smoking just for so short time ,no one must smoke during their mealtime . Moreover, statistics show that majority of the customers say that they would come to have a meal as usual .And take the airports and the cinema for example, where smoking has been banned for more than 10 years, the number of the passengers wasnÅft declined due to the policy at all .On the contrary, some restaurants become more popular with customers after the banning has started . Ireland has already put this policy into use since 2004 throughout the whole country, followed by so many European countries, and British even use the strict punishment to make smoking banned, all which tells us that smoking are sincerely regarded to be unhealthy and the banning throughout the country is becoming a unavoidable trend .So why donÅft China follow the trend which could absolutely benefit us in the long run? Some countries even rule that smoking is only allowed in peopleÅfs home . All in all, I suppose smoking should be banned in all the restaurants in China. 
I suppose that smoking should be completely banned at any restaurant in china. Firstly, in terms of health, as is widely known to everybody, smoking is definitely very harmful to peopleÅfs health. And what is worse, people who are around smokers will get second-hand smoking which does even more serious damage to health than the smoker himself. I suppose we can put it as Åg harm set, harm get Åh. It is quite easy to imagine a picture that in a restaurant, which is quite limited space, customers are talking and eating happily, however, several smokers make the restaurant foggy here and there, and while the other customers are enjoying themselves, unconsciously, inhaling victim smoker all the time and very likely to be suffocated by the dirty air. Especially when children is in this restaurant, I can hardly imagine what effect will it do year by year, but no doubt, things will turn out terrible. WhatÅfs more, if the smoker uncarefully drops the cigarette on the carpet or doesnÅft stub the cigarette out completely, it will quite probably cause an accidental fire, which is apparently a very dangerous thing. From my point of view, smoking is really troublesome and has potential risks. I advocate that smoking should be completely banned in restaurants in china. 
Although some people hold the view that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China, others opposite it.   The people who support that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China think that smoking is not only bad for the smokerÅfs own health, but also has bad influence on other peopleÅfs health. Secondhand smoke clearly kills people and the only way to control it is to ban smoking. Banning smoking in the restaurants is very good news for non-smokers, so that they can go out of restaurants and return home without nasty smelling. WhatÅfs more, smoking kills thousands of people and this is the best way to discourage people from smoking.   Others, however, look at this question in a totally different way and they hold that itÅfs unnecessary to ban smoking at all the restaurants in China. First of all, everyone has the right to decide whether smoke or not, some people believe that smoking can make them feel relax. Furthermore, the taxation of the cigarette contributes a lot to the National finance income. If smoking is banned in all the restaurants in China, a large number of people will lose job. At the same time, the customer of the restaurants will definitely reduce.   As far as IÅfm concerned, smoking brings serious health consequence, and the pollution to other people's atmospheres also makes it an environmental issue. But I also think that people have the right to choose whether smoke or not. On the other handÅCitÅfs undeniable that selling cigarettes bring huge profits to our country and the people whose work related to it. So the best way to deal with this problem is to have the smoking area and non-smoking area in all the restaurants instead of banning smoking at all the restaurants. 
Should smoking be completely banned at all the restaurants in China? Many people think so, I think it is a very realistic problem. As we all know, smoking is bad to our health. WhatÅfs more, it`s influence people around you. Restaurants is a place that you should pay attention to your behavior and manner very well. So from this point, smoking should be banned in the restaurants. But in the other hand, however, don`t think so. Some people feel that smoking shouldn`t be banned at the restaurants. In fact, it is a complicated thing. We cannot lightly say ÅgshouldÅh or ÅgshouldnÅftÅh. It influenced by many factors, first of all, it is difficult for government to control smoking people`s quantity. And if there has supplies, there has needs. If smoking is not be allowed in the restaurants, what will the people who really want to smoking do? In case of myself, I think instead of smoking in our own seats, the restaurants should make some special places for us to smoking. It will not only good for smokers, but also the others. However, it`s easier said than done. Only in reality we van know whether it is good or bad. 
   I do not like smoking at all . Many my classmates smoke and more and more classmates smoke . In my opinion I think smoking should completely banned .Firstly smoking is bad to health not just for the smokers but also for others who beside those smokers, for instants children and classmates . Secondly smokers need money to smoke . Some people everyday smokes very much and has to takes much time to smoke. What is worse , no people like the man whose month is bad smell and if people who you know smokes you must be influenced badly. Smoking is the worst thing that human produced I think .Now it is difficult to completely ban smoking . In the world now many people is smoking and at the same time many people dead because smoking. Those people are not worth to die and many of them have skills have ability to contribute to the world ,but they dead .Why ? just because smoking ! Smoking should completely banned for our children for our health for our future. No smoking has called long time we must contribute to it .   All above is my opinion .That is all.
AGREE. I am quite with this statement. I donÅft want to talk about whether it is good or not to smoke . the result is so clear. And I can understand why so many people still keep smoking will themselves know ÅhSMOKING IS BAD TO HEALTHÅh clearly. ItÅfs their habit.    But smoking in public should be banned . public place is a place where everyday a mess of people gather at including children women with babies and old people. Smoking is a habit of who is smoking ,but these guys have no rights to do harm to the people without the bad habit.   So I am agree with the statement.     Maybe someone think itÅfs much better to divide the restaurants into two part ÅgSMOKING ALLOWED Åg ones and ÅgSMOKING BANNEDÅh ones.  But I donÅft think so. for the fact that it is clear that smoking is bad to our health.  So  we should try to get everyone  out  of  the bad habit, and making every restaurants and even every public places no-smoking is also a great way by making smokers fell that they are not accepted by the others with the bad habit, and I believe that between smoking and being accept by public ,most people will choose the last one. 
  I donÅft quite agree with this. If smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants in China, customs who like smoking will go to the restaurants less often just because they are not allowed smoking, This will lead to the fact that the restaurants will make less money. It is not good for both the customs and the restaurants, I think.    Then smoking is allowed at all the restaurants? The answer is NO. If so maybe it is the turn for the customs who donÅft smoke not to go to the restaurants less often. So what shall we do? I think the restaurants maybe can set a smoking-room for the smokers. If they want to smoke, they can just go to the smoking-room and enjoy their time smoking. Just as usual as going to the toilet. And the smoking-room costs no money.    As is known to all, smoking has a bad effect on our health, but we canÅft force the people who smoke not to smoke. It depends on themselves but not us. To protect the people who donÅft smoke, what we can do is to separate them from the smokers. ThatÅfs my opinion.  
As the level of our lives becoming higher, we have more chances to patronize restaurants, cheap or expensive. At restaurants, itÅfs not difficult to find people having dinner during smoking. People just like me who disgusts with smoking   are always choked by the smoke. So I support that Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China, if there are no special areas in restaurants for smokers.           Not only because that I dislike smoking but also because that this action may leave a bad memory on tourists form foreign countries. As china is becoming a international country, especially after we holding the Olympic games successfully, we should pay more attention to our activities not to lose face for our grand country. WhatÅfs more, itÅfs a bad habit to smoke over a dinner for it will has a bad effect on your somatic and nervous system.       All in all ,I believe that Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China. 
 Personally, I totally agree with this statement. And I have two points here to support my opinion.    Firstly, smoking in public places, such as restaurants, is really harmful to the public health. It is widely acknowledged that the second-hand smoking could do significant harm to the people around you. WhatÅfs moreÅCbeing a decent person in this developing society requires every individual to take the responsibility to the whole community in every occasion. Therefore, banning smoking at all the restaurant is necessary and it can contribute to both the public health and showing our respect to others.    Secondly, banning smoking at restaurants can help to achieve a graceful environment for enjoying a tasty meal and communication. Apparently, in some cases, people go to restaurants for communication rather than food alone. And the stingy smell, such as smoke, can definitely disturb the atmosphere of talking. Anyway, banning smoking at all the restaurant does not indicate that it is inhuman or inconsiderate, having noticed in some restaurants that they provided the customers a rest room to handle their personal need for release themselves.    Based on those two points I have stressed, IÅfm in favor of the policy: Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China. 
 I donÅft quite agree with this. If smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants in China, customs who like smoking will go to the restaurants less often just because they are not allowed smoking, This will lead to the fact that the restaurants will make less money. It is not good for both the customs and the restaurants, I think.    Then smoking is allowed at all the restaurants? The answer is NO. If so maybe it is the turn for the customs who donÅft smoke not to go to the restaurants less often. So what shall we do? I think the restaurants maybe can set a smoking-room for the smokers. If they want to smoke, they can just go to the smoking-room and enjoy their time smoking. Just as usual as going to the toilet. And the smoking-room costs no money.    As is known to all, smoking has a bad effect on our health, but we canÅft force the people who smoke not to smoke. It depends on themselves but not us. To protect the people who donÅft smoke, what we can do is to separate them from the smokers. ThatÅfs my opinion.  
In my opinion, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in China. Firstly, smoking is bad for our body, because it can damage many organs. It is known that many of people get ill because of it, and some of the diseases even cannot be cured , as a result ,what is waiting for them is death. Secondly, smoking is not only bad for smokers but for people around them. Scientists have shown that the most serious victims are people around you when you smoking ,because the most polluted air is smoked by them not you .Maybe many of people are surprise at the fact and cannot believe it ,but it is the truth. Thirdly, if we have realized the badness of smoking and have decided to ban smoking , the government should do a favour so that restaurants all over the country can ban it together .The reason is that if only a few restaurants did it , people who like smoking will think that it were strange or unfair. As a result, they may choose another restaurant that does not ban it , instead. After a long time , banning smoking restaurants may give up , because their customs are decreasing , and what they have done is in vain . In a word , smoking is bad for not only you but me . It is better to ban it not only in restaurants but in anywhere.      
We all know that smoking is harmful to our health. But at the same time somebody also canÅft get themselves out from the unforgettable feelings brought by smoking. For that I think no smoking is necessary for person. Long time ago, a Chinese who called Lin Zexu raised the first activity of no smoking. Because smoking is not only do harm to our bodies but also poison people's mindsÅCit makes people donÅft want to study, to work, even to play. Maybe nowadays smoking wonÅft cause such phenomenon, but it also do harm to the lungs of people who smoke. Every year a lot of people die of lung disease caused by smoking, and people who smoke also live a shorter life than people who not smoke.  So that I agree with no smoking. If people smoke less, they will live more happily, and so do their family and friends. Nothing is more important than having a good health. 
It is fairly well that smoking in the restaurant is a bad behave which harms both the health of the smoker and others in the restaurant. But from my point of view, forbid it completely is impossible.   Suppose smoking is completely banned at all in the restaurant people may smoke outside it and then get into. Then the provisions will with no meaning.   It is well known that even though the tax of cigarettes is very high, the number of people who smoke is still very high. Therefore, forbidding smoking in all the restaurant is not a fundamental method to make people away from cigarettes.   Moreover, the restaurants in china are of different levels. And people in china also have different level of education. If smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants in China, there will be a lot of people who canÅft understand it and it will also have a bad influence on those small restaurants.   Considering the possible consequence above, I think it is reasonable to forbid smoking in high-grade restaurants, but forbidding smoking in all the restaurants at all is unrealistic and not feasible.  
 Now more and more people smoking in public,I think it doesnÅft only influence the smokers,but also have a strong impact on the other peopleÅfs healthy.So,I think smoking must be completely banned in China especially at all the restaurants.   Now let us have a conjecture,you are having dinner with your friends at a good restaurant.You are happily eating and chatting with each other.Then suddenly,you smell the unpleasant smell of cigarette,and then,when you eat your food,you will feel bad and canÅft swallow it only because the smoke is so strong.I think you must not be happy any more.So,I must tell the people who smoke at restaurants can you stop smoking at public for the purpose of themselves and others.    Think of this matter from the angle of the doctors,smoke have a very bad influence on peopleÅfs trachea,when human are eating,their tracheas are expanding,if breathe much smoke at this time,people are very easy to have tracheitis, bronchitis and other diseases like these.    In a word,smoking is bad for peopleÅfs healthy,smoking at restaurants is worse.Now,in China,this matter is very serious,so,we must help ourselves,when we see others smoking at restaurants,we should put a stop to them. 
Nowadays, more and more people in China get to contribute the habit of smoking. Not only the men, but also the women ,even some teenagers. As we all know, smoking does bad to our health especially when we have meals, so we should get away from it. Firstly, many fire disasters are resulted from smoking against regulations. If smoking can be completely banned at all the restaurants in China, we can avoid many tragedies.  Secondly , according to the scientists , it has the worst influence to our body if we inhalant the smoking gas while we are eating. So, we should not smoke at the eating time or in the restaurants.  WhatÅfs more , it does more harm to peopleÅfs health who indirectly inhalant the smoking gas than those who smokes directly. Just the restaurants always have many children there. For the health of the younger generation , adults should keep not smoking in the restaurants.  Last but not the least , in order to keep a good mood of enjoying the delicious food in restaurants , adults had better get away from smoking just a moment . 
I donÅft think banning smoking at all the restaurants in China is a good idea. ItÅfs no doubt that smoking do harm with our health.The best situation is that no one smokes any more,so smokers and those people around them can have a better life.But absolutely,it can never bu true.Since the fact is there are so many people smoking and canÅft keep away from it,such tough rule canÅft work well.We should also think of them. So in my opinion,the best way is set up smoking areas in the restaurants.Those smokers can smoking only in the areas.And of course,no-smoking areas is more than smoking areas.In this way,most of us can get rid of being affected with smog.Also smoker can have their space to Ågenjoy themselvesÅh. I hope maybe this way can reduce the number of smokers a little 
As everyone knows ,smoking isnÅft good to our health ,so dose smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants ? It is said that smoking is harmful not only to our health but also to the air. Smoking can lead to many diseases, such as lung cancer. Smoking affects non smokers more than it does smokers. According to a survey, the rate of passive smokers getting ill is higher than that of smokers. So, many nonsmokers are against smoking.      In restaurants, the harm of smoking is greater. ItÅfs not only bad to themselves and worse to others but also it pollutes environment by giving much poisonous gas off  into the air.     Therefore, that the government ban smoking is very necessary and important to us. It is a measure to protect our health and environment. So many people, especially nonsmokers are for the policy. Some people may say that it takes away some of their freedom. I think it is a one-sided view. If one wants to smoke, he may smoke in private, not in the restaurants. In fact, smokers still have the freedom of smoking.      But, I think, smokers had better give up smoking, not only in private places, but also everywhere. It will be beneficial to all of us. 
I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China. Restaurant is the place for us to have meals and relax. ItÅfs really hard for a man who never smoke to stand a people nearby smoke during meals.  Most of us wonÅft like a restaurant with strange smell, but itÅfs hard for them to clean up the smell, and provide the next consumer with a clean environment to have meals. As all of us know, smoking is harmful to our health, which is banned in most of the public place, but why it canÅft be banned in the restaurants? This is because the managers of the restaurants afraid that they will lose many consumers if other restaurants donÅft do the same thing. Their fears come from that most of the people go to the restaurants are adults, and in China, many of the men smoke when they grow up. If they ban it, it means keep lots of people out of the door, but they should also think that if smoking is allowed in the restaurants, they will lose many consumers who hate smoking, too. I think, the one who should take measures is our country, not the restaurants. Like the plastic bags, its just a small case. ItÅfs the best way, I think. 
As we know , smoking is harmful not only to our health but also to the environment. Smoking can lead to many diseases, such as lung cancer. smoking affects non-smokers more than it dose smoker. Ratio of passive smokers getting ill is higher than that of smoker. Some governments have banned smoking in all public places. As far as I am concerned, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in china.  Restaurants are also public place. There are many non-smokers. at restaurants, the harm of smoking is greater. Smoking can affect customersÅf mind if smokers are around. And smoking do great harm to non-smokers. It is unfair for them. I think it is laughable if there is some one who is smoking at a clean restaurant. Smoking pollutes environment by giving much poisonous vapour off into the air. the government ban smoking at restaurant  is very necessary and important to us.  It is a measure to protect our health and environment.  Some people say that it takes away some of our freedom. I think it is a one-sided view. If one wants to smoke, he may smoke in private, not in the public places include restaurants. In fact, smokers still have the freedom of smoking. But, I think, smokers had better give up smoking, not only in private places, but also in the public places, everywhere. It will be beneficial to all of us. 
We all know that itÅfs harmful for people to smoke whether in his 20s or his 50s.Å@It seems that smokers are becoming younger and the number larger.Å@And people pay more attention to smoking.Å@But I donÅft think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China and itÅfs impossible to do that too.Å@There may be some people are strongly against smoking and they just canÅft stand the smell.Å@We can just open up some restaurants that ban smoking or make a part of the restaurants named no-smoking areas.     When we entire the society,Å@smoking is not just a form of entertainment, but a way of communication. Of course, smoking a lot is absolutely not allowed. IÅfm non-smoker and I donÅft know how beautiful the cigarette is that so many people are addicted to it. I donÅft want to smoke in the future either. Since smoking canÅft be banned at once we should make up our mind to do something. Not to ban it at all the restaurants but to let people know how harmful it is. And let more and more people experience the happiness of clear air and clear mouth. At that time we neednÅft to ban it and people just donÅft want to smoke neither in the restaurants nor somewhere else.  
People smoke for many things,some for fatigue,some just for the wonderful feelings.There seems to be good to the smokers,and however, their bodies have been always remonstrating.   At present, so many public places have signs say, No smoking. This is because people are gradually aware of the harm of smoking. LetÅfs try to have a scene: when you are sitting in a beautiful restaurant, having some delicious food that is your favorite. At that time, smokers are around you which makes you hard to breath, let along eat food.You must want a waiter to keep the smoker away or out of the restaurant so that you could continue your dinner.   There actually exist another scene: when you are off work, you are tired, so tired that you donÅft want to go home to do the supper yourself. Suddenly there appears a restaurant. Dragging yourself in, sitting in the soft sofa. you light a cigarette. you would think that°Øs the most wonderful things in your life. There comes the waiter, who are keeping you away from your beautiful  dream, this time you are so much wanting there isnÅft a rule that smoking isnÅft banned.   That is the fact, different people have different ideas around one thing. Generally speaking, smoking to the smoker as not a bed thing. but when happens in a public place like a restaurant where there are some propel dislike smoking,it should be banned. 
As ChineseÅfs conscious of public manner and healthy problems greatly developed, there has been a general discussion over smoking, one of the questions under debate is whether smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China.  In my point of view, smoking in public is so bad a thing that should not only be banned at restaurants but also all the public places such as hospitals and shopping malls for following reasons.  First and foremost, no one can deny that smoking does harm to peopleÅfs body. According to a recent survey, about four million people die each year from diseases linked to smoking. I have seen a short movie online ? an experiment which shows the extreme horrible results of having been smoked 400 cigarettes. The chemical substance contained in cigarettes can be left in blood vein for many years just like poison. Moreover, when smokers ease their nerves and pressures by smoking, they themselves only breathe in 30% of the tobacco, whereas people nearby breathe in the rest through the second-hand smoking.  Besides, there comes the statistics showing that many of fire accidents occur each year due to the thrown cigarettes ends.  Last but not least, restaurants are places for people to enjoy delicious food , not to bear tobacco. Most female and children canÅft have a comfortable environment while someone are smoking, let along being forced to breathe the unpleasant smell.  In the end ,IÅfm in favor of the discussion of banning smoking at all restaurants in China completely .  
I must say smoking in the restaurant is very impolite.Å@It may destroy other's appetite and do harm to the health of others.   As a non-smoke person, I hate the smoke which is made by smokers in every place at every time. So if someone advice banning smoking at restaurant, I will put up two hands to show my agreement. And I believe that it will must be banned someday.   However, as a big country with a large amount of smokers, banning all of them smoking in the restaurant is not easy. Most of them will be against it and may say that it harms their rights. The host of the restaurant will hate the rule more than the smokers, because it will have a bad effect on their making money. The unwillingness of the most important two roles--the smokers and host will delay the process of banning the smokers smoke in the restaurant and become a big problem when the government perform the rule.   But the rule that banning smokers smoke in the restaurant is good to the majority and have much more supporters. What's more, it have to do with a nation's image. So the government should ban smoking in restaurant to meet the most people's requirement. 
I agree with the statement that the smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China.I have some  reasons and specific details to support my answer.   In my opinion, smoking at restaurants is doing more harm than good. On the one hand, smoking is bad for our health. Moreover, if you smoking at the restaurants, it not only does harm to your body,but also has bad effects on other's health. On another hands, smoking will give off a large amount of poisonous gas which will pollute the fresh air. Especially, at the restaurants is impossible for the gas to get through. So smoking at the restaurants causes more harms than at outside. In addition, smoking is a waste of money that we can use for some meaningful things.    I also think that carrying out the statement is of benefit to us. It is helpful to build up our bodies, so that we can live a healthy life. Besides,it is also contributed to improve quality the of the restaurant' air, which will bring a refreshing environment for people who have dinner at restaurants. What's more, it helps us to develop good and healthy habits.    In one word,the statement that smoking should be completely banned at restaurants in China is necessary for us. If it will be carried out ,I will do my best to support it. That' all. 
I donÅft agree with the statement that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in China. First, I want to say, one kind functions of smoking is relaxing oneself. And for a lot of restaurants in China, the slogan is Ågcustomer is the God, we will do whatever to fill GodÅfs needs.Åh So if their God want to relax himself by smoking, how can they stop him? Then, we have to face a reality, that in China, especially for Chinese businessmen, cigarette and wine are the most common way to make their relations closer, which means that they are helpful to their cooperation. How such a useful way should be banned? Maybe in one way, it can influent our economy development.  I think the reason why people want to ban smoking at the restaurant is it make the air terrible. In fact, many restaurants have thought about it, they set the non-smoking rooms and smoking rooms, which is really convenient for all the people.   Everyone has his right to enjoy himself at the restaurants, so itÅfs really not a good rule to ban people to smoke.   
 I totally support the statement.    Smoking is harmful not only to smokers but also to the people around, not to say in the restaurants. No one has the right to harm others. But as we know some people canÅft help smoking in the restaurants, so government should do something to ban it.    What is restaurant? Restaurant is not only the place we have lunch and dinner, it is also the place we have rest and lighten ourselves. Imagine that you are in a restaurant which is full of smoke, what you want to do now? The first thing I will do is run away from the lousy place.  In fact, I think it is very rude to smoke in the restaurant. I the restaurant, we often meet some foreigners. No matter what we say or what we do represent our country, our China. The famous newspaper <<New York Times >> has said that china is the most civilized ancient country in the world. But in the daily life, what we Chinese do not show this. Smoking in the restaurants will let the foreigners feel down about us.  Also, if the restaurants are small, smoking will easily cause a fire. As for the reasons above, smoking should be banned in all of chinaÅfs restaurants. 
Ancients believed that tobacco is a harmful for human-beings.In modern times,it also may cause dyspnea, cough, sputum and wheezing, and so on.    Smoking can be a hobby ,but if harms other health ,a hobby may change to a killer.especially in public places.   If pregnant women smoking,it may have bad effect to a new-born baby.Morever,enviornment are seriously polluted.   Once, an advertisement said ,in order that there is no hole in the carpet,and there is no hole in your lung,please not smoke in public.That is really true. Government is really think carefully for our lives ,our earth.   So ,Stop  smoking in the restaurant is really necessary!  
It is widely known by people in the world that smoking is bad for our health. Many people die for the lung cancer which caused by smoke. And it is more dangerous for the people who don not smoke themselves but their friends, relatives or colleagues smoke a lot. It is said that it does two times harm to others and to themselves. So to smoke in the public is irresponsible.   As above says, I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in china. But this needs time and rules. Because china has a large population, the number of smokers is deserved large. Now many people have realized that there are only harms to smoke without benefit. And a lot of smokers choose to quit smoking. But this need a good condition, in some restaurants in china the smell of cigarettes is so strong that many people especially woman and children  
We all know that itÅfs harmful for people to smoke whether in his 20s or his 50s.It seems that smokers are becoming younger and the number larger.And people pay more attention to smoking.But I donÅft think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China and itÅfs impossible to do that too.There may be some people are strongly against smoking and they just canÅft stand the smell.We can just open up some restaurants that ban smoking or make a part of the restaurants named no-smoking areas.     When we entre the society,smoking is not just a form of entertainment,but a way of communication.Of course,smoking a lot is absolutely not allowed.IÅfm non-smoker and I donÅft know how beautiful the cigeratte is that so many people are addicted to it.I donÅft want to smoke in the future either.Since smoking canÅft be banned at once we should make up our mind to do something.Not to ban it at all the restaurants but to let people know how harmful it is.And let more and more people expierence the happiness of clear air and clear mouth.At that time we neednÅft to ban it and people just donÅft want to smoke neither in the restaurants nor somewhere else.  
 It is universally acknowledged that smoking has a great influence on our health However, the trend of smoking has gone from bad to worse.  Wherever it is,we can see people are smoking.For smoking has a long history ,it is impossible to forbid all men to smoke at once, but it is possible to ban it at the restaurants in China.It is time the authorities concerned took proper steps to solve the smoking problem.  In fact ,on no account can we ignore the harm of smoking .The recent statistics show that a great many people get cancer because of cigarette.What is more every year thousands of people are killed by smoking either directly or indirectly .  Restaurants are crowded with people ,when people smoke in it, it will be drowned in smoke.Then all the people become smokes weather they like it or not.  Moreover,many people are similar to the smoke,when they are in such a smoky world,they may feel uncomfortable and have no appetite.Becides,if they  pregnant women, it can affect their babies directly.Therefor,cigarette is threatening our health in its way.  So precious is life that we can not afford to destroy it,and nothing is more important than to ban smoking. 
 I donÅft agree the statement that smoking should be completely banned at the restaurants in China.  IÅfm not a smoker, and I donÅft like people smoking around me. But I still donÅft think it is not a good idea to completely forbid people smoking at the restaurants in China.  On one hand, smoking is not forbidden by the whole society. All the countries have no such laws that completely forbidding smoking. Though nicotine makes people get addicted, making people die earlier. This is quite similar as drugs. The reason that tobacco has never been banned is that great amount of taxes are paid by the smokers and tobacco companies. This has been a important part of all the tax income to the governments.  So rights are given to the people. Smoking is not about affecting people nearby, itÅfs more like a right of freedom and fairness. Since governments never banned smoking, in my opinion, dividing guests into smoking area and non-smoking area at the restaurants would be a great idea for now.  But I am looking forward to the day that all tobacco is forbidden all over the world, not only in Chinese restaurants. 
At recently, there is a heated view whether smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in China. With the development of the society, Smoking has became a world problem. there are more and more people to smoke. Many people think pressure of family, work, life lead to smoke. Though smoker have many reasons to smoke. they think smoking is own thing. But in my opinion ,Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China. On the one hand, Smoking will be effect peopleÅfs health and life. People will have a bad effects. Some people start to smoke when they are young. When they stop to smoke they feel terrible. They will feel headache. Whatever they do, they donÅft have no action. On the other hand, when you smoke in restaurants, you will be effect other peopleÅfs  health. It have worse effects. it will destroy restaurants environment. And non-smoker will be terrible. So smoker effect another .They maybe do not find their action will hurt anther people. Though analysis of above, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China. The government could make law to forbid smoking in restaurants. And it warn smoking will effect yourself and another peopleÅfs health. It will many good aspects to life. In a word, Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China.  
Now more and more people are smoking, especially in some public places, such as restaurant. So smoking is becoming a problem for us.    As we all know, smoking is bad for our health, our organ?lungs. But since the cigarette has been as a kind of social customs which widely used in our society, the ÅgNo SmokingÅh seems to be difficult.    In my opinion, I think smoking should be banned in the restaurant. The first reason, smoking will lead to the disaster?fire. When people go to the restaurant, they enjoy themselves very much, so that they may forget the consciousness of fire prevention. Especially when some men drink a lot and become unconscious, some accident will happen. ItÅfs terrible, and the consequence is unimagined. The second, I think the smoking is worse for the other people around the smokers. It is said that smoking indirectly is worse for health than smoking directly. The third, cigarette not only costs money but also ruins our body. I canÅft find any advantages from it. Last, if someone is addicted to it, he canÅft drop it easily. 
 I donÅft agree with the statement.   Firstly, I think it is impossible to make everyone not smoke at all the restaurants in China. Because there were too many restaurants in China.   Secondly, I think it is not necessary to ban people to smoke at all the restaurants.    If we donÅft want to make others smoke the second-hand smoke, we can make no-smoking place for them to go.    As there are so many people in China, it is difficult to practice the rule.    But I think we can change the rule into another way. We can ask people to smoke at smoking rooms.    Comparing with banning smoking at restaurants, I think it is better to tell smokers how bad it is to smoke and make themselves stop smoking.   So I donÅft agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China.    
I disagree with this statement for several reasons.  While it can be argued that having a part-time job is valuable preparation for a full-time job that the student will acquire upon graduation, this is often not the case. In many cases, any part-time employment obtained by a student will be in a field, and of a nature that is completely unrelated to that of their chosen course of study. For example, a student studying engineering has very little valuable experience to gain from working as a waiter in a restaurant.   Moreover, there is ample reason for students to not engage in part-time employment. Such a job can often mean a considerable amount of additional stress on top of that created by their studies. The stress of studying can also be increased, as there is less time available to accomplish it. Additionally, many part-time jobs can leave one tired, and thus unable to focus effectively on their studies?resulting in a lower quality of school work being produced.  Therefore, if a part-time job related to the studentsÅf field of study can be found (such as an internship), then it may be worth pursuing, but otherwise part-time employment should only be sought if it is necessary for financial reasons (i.e., to pay tuition fees). 
Yes, I agree that college students should have part-time jobs. Time is money as they say. And if you have a little extra time, then making some extra money is not so bad for the following reasons:-  To begin with, today's job market has become highly competitive and in most of the cases a college degree does not guarantee a job or a job that pays well. Most of the advertisements that appear in the newspapers or on on-line portals, the preferred candidates even for entry level positions are with some experience. As a college student, there are several ways to acquire experience that are career oriented such as internships, practical experiences. Another option is a part-time job.  Part-time jobs offer several benefits to the college students. Primarily, the financial benefit. Apart from this, part time employment lays the foundation of the work history for the future. For this reason, students should carefully consider and select their part-time positions in order to acquire valuable work skill. By carefully selecting job, the gaps in the academic qualification can be minimized; also experience makes the candidate more attractive to the potential employers. Part-time employment helps to gain a better understanding of the chosen career field.  Part-time employment, whether in a corporate organization or hotel industry helps to evolve skills important to a potential employer. These skills may include leadership skills, commitment, team spirit and interpersonal skills, time management and taking criticism positively. Besides the knowledge gained through the educational experiences, employers today are pursuing candidates who are productive with well developed overall personality and are able to assimilate themselves into the environment of the organization. The skills that are learnt through part-time position will expand and increase skills and abilities at the same time benefiting financially. 
    I agree with the statement that college students should have part-time jobs. There are two reasons for this.     The first reason is the money issue. Many college students complain that they donÅft have enough money to spend even on food at times. Having a part-time job gives students that extra money they may need in such an emergency. Saving the money earned through work a little at a time is also a good idea. The alternative is asking others, like parents or friends, for money. However, doing so again and again may put some strains on the relationships with the people you borrowed from. They may eventually see you as a ÅevampireÅf. This is especially true with friends. College students need to show that theyÅfre putting the effort into keeping themselves financially stable. People are more willing to help when you need money, if they see that you are trying to do something on your part to earn money.     The other reason for having a part-time job while in college is work experience. Of course, having a part-time job that is related to your major is an advantage. For example, if your major is teaching and you take a part-time job tutoring high school students, you will have a chance to put into use some of the theories and practices you learned in the classes you are taking. By doing this, youÅfll know what works well and what doesnÅft. Having a part-time job unrelated to your major could also benefit you by expanding your horizons thus increasing your job opportunities after college.     In conclusion, I encourage all students to take part-time jobs because it is a good opportunity for them to do something productive not only for their present situations but also their futures.  
Japanese college students should not have part-time jobs. They have enough distractions as it is. Moreover, part-time jobs are not real jobs, and therefore will not provide useful experience.   Japanese society is highly specialized. Workers are not expected to function well in a broad range of contexts. They are expected to do one job and do it well. Evaluations are all important. Workers must be familiar with what others have done in their area of specialty. If they don't know what others have done, whatever they might produce will not fit in. Neither they, nor what they produce, will be valuable to society. Learning what others have done is a full-time job by itself.   Because it's external to their subject, part-time work will interfere with their grades, and with specialization. It's usually menial work, not fit for a specialist, not real work at all. Such experience is useless when they get their jobs in their chosen fields.  Internships are not part-time jobs. They are obtained in the field of specialty, and thus provide relevant experience. And the money they provide is not enough to be another source of temptation. Internships are all they need.  Japanese colleges provide club activities to help students socialize. These activities are sufficient to teach them how to behave in society. Part-time jobs will only take them away from club activities and give them unstructured social experiences with unpredictable results. They become unwilling and unable to fit in with their fellow students and teachers.  Part-time work that is available to college students is unworthy of the finely honed workers Japanese society demands.
I strongly believe that itÅfs important for all students to have a part-time job. The main reason for this is that I believe students can gain a lot of valuable life experience and preparation for life after graduation through entering the workforce prior to their graduation. Many recently-graduated students are woefully unprepared for the realities and responsibilities of full-time employment. This can be particularly true for university students. The nature of university life is such that one can become used to staying up late at night, sleeping in late, neglecting their commitments (i.e., classes), with little or no immediate repercussions. As a result, it can often be difficult for students to make the necessary lifestyle adjustment upon graduation and subsequent employment. A part-time job, undertaken while still pursuing one's studies, can be quite helpful in this regard. Maintaining a part-time job while studying can also be a valuable exercise in personal financial management. Many recent graduates similarly have difficulty in managing their finances responsibly. In many western countries, this unfortunate reality often combines with high levels of debt (on credit cards, student loans, etc.) to leave many recent graduates in grave financial peril. A part-time job can help by not only providing experience in managing personal cash flow, but also provide at least a small amount of income with which to counter such debts. A part-time job is a very good idea for students. 
For several reasons, I largely agree with this statement.  Firstly, having been a college student myself, I am aware of the financial pressures generated as a result of college tuition fees and living expenses. Often, these expenses are met through a combination of loans, grants or family savings, and they usually restrict the student's lifestyle during a crucial period in their adult development. For college students, earning a little extra money is a constructive way of easing these financial pressures and allowing them to lead a more independent and adult lifestyle.  Secondly, with regards to employment prospects, the level of qualification obtained by the student is rarely the only factor that employers will consider. For the majority of graduate jobs, professional and transferable skills, such as the ability to communicate with customers and to be responsible with their time, are almost as important as academic achievement. Not only is a part-time job a valuable way of demonstrating these attributes, but it also gives students an idea of what aspects of employment they enjoy and what to expect of working life once they graduate.  Thirdly, on a wider scale, part-time jobs are a necessity in an economical sense. Many businesses require a work force that is flexible and students are very valuable in this regard, as they are able to fill part-time positions that would otherwise be difficult to fill with a full-time member of staff.    In contrast to these arguments however, it must also be argued that the ability of a student to cope with a job and their academic commitments depends strongly on the student's personal situation. This is largely determined by their financial condition, their year of study and the type of course they are pursuing.  
I believe that working during school builds valuable skills, encourages students to have a financial stake in their education, and prepares them for the real world they will encounter after college.  ThereÅfre countless skills that can be acquired from any part-time job. The most readily apparent skills have to do with balancing school work and the responsibilities of one's job. Skills like prioritization, multitasking, and balancing responsibilities are all important to finding success as an adult, and working while going to college provides the perfect training ground to improve these skills.  Too often the financial burden of a college education is supported entirely by a student's parents, with the consequence that students have little concept of the actual cost of their education. Without a financial "stake" in the true cost of their education, students often don't place the importance in their studies that they would were the fees for classes coming out of their own pockets. That is where a part-time job can help, by allowing students to contribute more to the cost of their education, and by giving them a better understanding of the value of money by having to earn it themselves.  Many students find it difficult to transition from the world of the college campus to the work world following graduation. College campuses are unique environments where the passion for learning and discovery are cultivated. ItÅfs very important that colleges continue to maintain this environment where one can explore talents and interests to the full extent of one's abilities without worrying about whether course work can translate directly into a salable product. However, part-time jobs, particularly ones directly related to one's field of study, are very important to expose students, even if only partially, to the work world that awaits them after graduation. 
Should all students have a part-time job? The answer to this question is subjective?it depends on the student. A blanket, yes-or-no answer would overlook the various relevant factors in a studentÅfs life that are different from case to case. These factors include, but are not limited to: the need for income (for tuition, school supplies, living expenses, etc.), the probable impact on the studentÅfs available time and energy level (and the resulting reduction of their effectiveness in studying and completing assignments), as well as the relevance of the job in question to their field of study. Considerations pertaining to the first of these factors are fairly straightforward?the student either requires additional income to support their education, or they do not. The importance of a job rises and falls in relation to the level of this need. The second factor, by nature, would never increase the importance of having a job, but could increase the importance of not having one. If the demands of a job are too great (relative to the ability of the student to cope with them in addition to their scholastic responsibilities), then they should not keep the job. The last factor is the most complicated. It requires a determination on the part of the student as to whether or not they stand to gain any professional benefit from a particular job. For example, working in a convenience store would be of little use to an engineering student, but may be of some educational value to someone studying business management. Each student must weigh these factors and decide whether a part-time job is important or not based on the particulars of their own situation. 
I believe it is important for college students to have part-time jobs.  The main reason I feel this way is that it allows students to start building a strong work ethic.  It is a difficult transition entering the work force as an adult after college.  And part-time jobs provide valuable experience to help ease this transition.  Young people must study not only academic subjects but also must learn social and financial lessons to be successful in life. Having a part-time job also helps students to become financially independent of their parents.  They can use the extra money to start saving and also to enjoy their free time more. Having a job also provides students with structure so they can learn how to divide their time to be successful in all areas of life. While working, students can make valuable business contacts to help them get a full-time job after they graduate.  The best part-time job then would be one in a field in which the student intends to pursue a career. However, the demands of a job, even a part-time one, can be exhausting.  So students must not let their jobs interfere with their academic studies.  If a part-time job becomes time-consuming or stressful they must keep their priorities straight.  If necessary they should quit their jobs rather than sacrifice their academic success. Despite the risks though, I believe having a part-time job as a college student is beneficial and important. 
To say, that it is important for college students to have a part-time job, is to imply that it is important for them all to work. Many students need to support themselves through college by working, but for some it just to earn a little extra pocket money. Some students should have as little distractions as possible, for example those studying their final years of medicine.    For three reasons it can however be a useful life lesson. Firstly it gives students a chance to experience the world of work before they enter into it. They can get a taste of what is to come, or what might be if they don't manage to secure a graduate position.  They also learn what it means to earn money for themselves rather than relying on their parents or support from organisations.  Perhaps this may teach some the true value of money and working. Lastly, it allows them to explore the world lying beyond the college gates. They get to work with people outside of their immediate social circles and meet new people and friends.   The opportunities that work offers should also be considered against the student's college work load. Too much work may hinder their performance. Not having enough money for books would also be a hindrance.   I myself worked my way through university. It didn't really get in the way until the last weeks of my final year, when my workload was huge and having to leave it to go and work was not productive. Therefore I conclude now, as I did then, that the student needs to weigh up the benefits and costs of taking on extra work.   
To a certain extent I agree with the idea of college students having part-time jobs. I understand that for some of them it is a matter of necessity. Not every family can afford maintaining their son or daughter to entirely dedicate him or herself to the studies; moreover, the costs of studying in a college are getting higher and higher by the year. Nevertheless, this period is extreme important for maturing the future professional and a part-time job not directly related to the course could consume part of the momentum and energy that could preciously be used for their graduation.  There are innumerous cases of students working so hard during their so-called part-time jobs that once they are back to their classrooms they lack the necessary power to concentrate and take an active role on the learning process. The extra time (when thereÅfs some!) is used only for resting, and the students see themselves acquiring knowledge exclusively from their poor participation on their colleges, with no time dedicated to their books.  A solution could be more scholarships from the government or at least a system that would allow students get only part-time jobs that could help them put the theories they are learning from their books and classrooms into practice. 
In comparison to those who do not go to college, young adults tend to, but not always of course, work in jobs that do not require as much education or specialisation than those of their college counterparts. Generally, non college students have to adapt from school life to work in a relatively short time but this is less of a problem, since this change is more manageable as the work concerned is usually less sophisticated.  This is not the case with college or university students. By working part time whilst furthering their studies, they are able to gain a valuable insight about assimilation into the workforce. This bridging effect better enables them to adapt quickly in their leap from education to the workforce.   Working part time teaches them valuable practical lessons about life and employment that theory based universities and colleges cannot be expected to. College and university graduatesÅf jobs are likely to be more sophisticated and as such, I believe working part time is a valuable experience for such students. It teaches them about budgeting, work ethics, workplace relationships, time management, productivity and so on in a practical manner and can help universities and colleges focus less on these issues and instead concentrate on the core course material for their respective field. 
We hope that students always have their studies as their principle concern. But, of course that's not always the case. If you are a full-time college student, then by definition you are not a full-time worker. So it follows that many may have money problems. Some are perhaps fully supported by organisations or by their families and have no need of extra income. Others, perhaps older, have saved money before their courses began. But many will fall somewhere in between and need to earn a little bit of book or pocket money.   So, some students need money and so they get a part time job. However, what other benefits does working hold for students? It allows them to escape from the confines of the campus. To explore new worlds beyond the hard study that has brought them so far. They are young adults now and can explore all the adult world has to offer. Working part-time allows them to dip their toes into the unfathomable waters that hold the world of work, before they become fully immersed. Thereby preparing them for a world they will have to traverse for the rest of their lives.   Wages from gainful employment hold another benefit. They offer the ability to sample the delights of the adult world. We may want students to study hard, but they want to try out things that were previously unavailable to them.  The experiences that part-time work offers are going to help young people to become fully rounded people. They will know more of life outside the academic world and they will know a little of what money can get you and what it takes to earn it. They will hopefully appreciate it if they are paying for the next round of drinks. 
Students should very definitely work while in college, the harder the job the better. They should learn to suffer. Suffering is important. And it won't kill them.  Part time jobs are often really hard work. But too many college students don't know that hard work can be fun.  Jobs available to students are mostly basic jobs, doing simple tasks. Learning to do basic and simple tasks is an important part of education.  And it's important to have the experience, to know that hard work and suffering and doing menial labor isn't fatal.  But timing is important, too.   Students who work in Japan are different from students who work in America. Most students in Japan don't pay their own tuition, books, rent, food, or fees, and they don't usually get married while in school. So, where students in America work their way through school, students in Japan generally work to get money for a little more freedom.  In the sophomore year, studying is more important. So most sophomores should focus on studying, and not work at part time jobs. But by the 4th year, it's important to work, to round out an education. If not a part time job, then participation in a service organization can also teach these important lessons.  It is very important for students to work.  
I disagree with this statement for the following three reasons. The first reason is that a college studentÅfs prime purpose in life is to study.  They should spend all their available time learning new things.  This is the best use of their time. Cleaning toilets or serving burgers is a real waste of a college education.  Secondly, I also think that they donÅft really learn anything that useful from working a part time job.  Some people argue that they learn a lot from working while studying.  I disagree. Maybe they learn how to serve someone in a restaurant or clean some dishes but that pales in comparison with learning international law or advanced mechanical engineering. Students should be focused on learning difficult things that they canÅft teach themselves.  Thirdly, I truly believe that the only reason why some students have to have part time jobs is that the cost of education is too high. If it was made more affordable then poor students who are smart, hard working or gifted could get a full and proper education. It would be better for the colleges to reduce their fees and allow the students to spend more time studying rather than working.  I am against the statement because I firmly believe that students should be encouraged to study hard and reach their full potential rather than waste their time doing meaningless, unchallenging and pointless part time jobs. 
College is an important opportunity for anyone fortunate enough to be able to attend.  Not everyone is able to go to college and college students must use the time they have wisely to learn as much as they can before moving on in life.  It is for this reason that students should refrain from working a part-time job while in school. There are many benefits to having a part-time job, earning your own money, expanding your circle of friends, etc.  But more than that, having a job takes time.  And as any college student knows, time is their most precious commodity. Consider an average part-time job, working 20 hours, 5 days a week.  Getting ready for work and driving there and back can easily take an extra hour each day.  That's 25 hours of study time lost per week. There is also a high risk a part-time job will cause stress.  College is stressful enough without the added frustration of a job.  Maintaining friendly relationships with coworkers is bound to take up even more time. So while it may be tempting to take a part-time job for the extra money it offers, students should be urged to focus on their studies instead.  They will have to enter the work force soon enough after they graduate. 
I believe it is very important for college students to get a part-time job.  First of all, during oneÅfs college years, the transition from being a dependent child to an independent adult is rapidly underway.  Quite often, the students have moved away from home and must take responsibility for many aspects of their lives, ranging from getting up and going to bed, to making sure their homework is completed on time.  And for those living outside of university dormitories, preparing breakfast, lunch and dinner is also entirely up to them.  And, even if the students are still living with their parents while in college, they never-the-less are trying to build an identity for themselves and taking on many of the responsibilities IÅfve mentioned.  I admit this may seem like a lot to handle for a person in their late teens or early twenties.  And I also understand that adding a part-time job on top of all of this may appear to provide an unnecessary burden, but the contrary is true.  By adding a job to the aforementioned list of responsibilities, the students gain the added benefit of remuneration.  As such, the personal satisfaction of gaining financial independence in life is enormous, and the added self-esteem can manifest itself in improved performance in school and a growing sense of securing their place in the world.  And of course, it makes dating much easier, since they donÅft have to ask their parents for money.
